            `Older adults and individuals with disabilities increasingly rely on their 
            neighborhood environments for essential activities. However, in U.S. car-dependent 
            neighborhoods, where many older adults reside, mobility options are often inadequate, 
            especially for those with disabilities. Emerging autonomous mobility technologies, 
            such as autonomous vehicles, autonomous electric-powered wheelchairs, autonomous 
            motorized scooters, and autonomous deliver robots offer potential new solutions. 
            Yet, current policies and regulations, like the Americans with Disabilites Act (ADA) 
            standards for accessible design, lag these technological advancements. This project 
            proposes a new conceptual framework, termed "Autonomous Universal Access (AUA)," to 
            support updating existing accessibility policies for better integrating autonomous 
            mobility into the built environment.`,
